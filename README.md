MokeSell Website Design

Purpose:
The purpose of this application is designed to provide a seamless and engaging platform for users to buy and sell second-hand or new goods. The primary goal is to enable users to declutter their homes while earning money and to offer buyers a trustworthy marketplace to find what they need. By fostering trust through features such as reviews, ratings, and chat, the platform ensures a secure and interactive experience for both buyers and sellers.
As a user, it would be an easy experience as the navigation bar is clear and easy to understand. Moreover, we have a help page linked at the bottom of the footer for easy access. In the homepage, there are features such as FOR YOU, YOUR FRIENDS as well as TRENDING listings to broaden the user's knowledge and find things similar to their taste. To further enhance the experience, we added a filtering option to filter the listings based on category. In the profile page, there is another navigation bar within the user's own account. He or she can look at their own listings and bump whenever they want,  look at their own reviews, take a look at their coins, create wishlists for people to buy things for them, their liked listings, games, as well as settings. 

This eCommerce platform caters to users of all ages, providing an engaging, trustworthy, and feature-rich experience for buying and selling items. With intuitive design, innovative features like loyalty rewards, and interactive elements, this platform sets itself apart from competitors by creating value for both buyers and sellers.

Design Process:

We used a mixture of red and hints of blue as there is a combination of warmth and coolness. In the website, it would look very playful and welcoming, perfect and versatile for this ecommerce app. Our main goal is to encourage users of all age to use this platform to declutter their homes while being able to earn money from doing this. The strengths of this website is that it provides a comprehensive user experience as features such as reviews, ratings and chat builds a stronger trust between buyers and sellers. Category browsing also makes it easier for users to search for certain specific products they intend to buy. Moreover, the layout ensures intuitive navigation and usability across all devices. Typography and color schemes are carefully chosen for readability and aesthetics purposes. 

For the ecommerce feature, we added a “wishlist goals” feature, where we will gamify wishlists by rewarding users when they purchase items from their wishlist cart, and they will then be able to earn exclusive deals and loyalty points! Users can set their wishlists to the public so that their family and friends are able to view them and this would be helpful for gifting occasions. The games portion of this would be that there are achievement badges for every milestone that they hit.

All features are:
Wishlist Goals for users to share their wishlist and be motivated to earn points.
Game System to have fun and earn coins.
Account Creation and Login where users can create an account and log in to the platform seamlessly.
